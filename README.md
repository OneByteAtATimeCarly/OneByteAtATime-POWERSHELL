We each live on our own specific and finite island of knowledge, surrounded by an infinite sea of ignorance. As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance (John Archibald Wheeler). Learning a little more each day about the infinite things to know in this universe doesnâ€™t lead to an answer, or even a final destination. It only leads to more questions and mysteries unsolved. Each day we discover there are even more things that exist that we didn't even know existed the day before. There is always more to learn, and there will never be an end to this learning. The only way to cope with the never-ending task of trying to tame the infinity that surrounds us with the finite minds inside us is to live each day whittling away at our ignorance "one byte at a time". Step by step, line by line, day by day, byte by byte. This github repository will host code for the OneByteAtATime YouTube channel that meanders through projects that cover: PowerShell.
